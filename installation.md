# QGIS installation

To save time in class, let's download QGIS. You can find it [here](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/). 

As of this writing, 2.18.7 is available. Click download now. 

Because I'm on a Windows machine, your screen may look a little different. But you want the 64 bit installer.

Once you download QGIS, download and install it. It's pretty self explanatory. When it asks you if you want to add North Carolina and other test data, don't bother. We just need the program installed.
