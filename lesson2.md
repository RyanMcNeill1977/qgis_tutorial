# QGIS Lesson 2

OK. So in the first lesson we learned to make a basic map. But that's not why we're here. Let's do something more interesting. 

### Earthquake! 

Believe it or not, Oklahoma is now one of the most seismically active areas in the country. Scientists link the massive increase
in seismicity to wastewater injection wells, which store waste from the fracking process used to pry loose natural gas from the ground. 

So lets figure out which communities have been the site of the most earthquake epicenters. 

To make things easy, I've downloaded the earthquake data for you. The source of the data is the [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/).

I selected all quakes with a magnitude greater than 2.5 between 5/10/2013 and 5/10/2017. 

Obviously if you were working with this data for a real story, you'd want to read the documentation and discuss with USGS officials 
about any caveats that might exist with this data. But for our class, we'll skip that step. 

Let's fire up QGIS.
