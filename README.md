# GIS lessons

I'm a big fan of maps. 

Displaying data spatially can reveal remarkable trends in data that you would otherwise miss just looking at rows and columns in a spreadsheet. 

This is a tutorial I wrote while co-teaching a data-driven journalism class in Spring 2017 at CUNY's Graduate School of Journalism. At work, I'm an ArcGIS user so I'm a bit of a QGIS noob. Please let me know if you see anything I should change. 

The biggest to-do is to expand the section on projections in lesson two. 

Go to [lesson one.](/lesson1.md)
Go to [lesson two.](/lesson2.md)
