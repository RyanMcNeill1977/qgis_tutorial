# Getting started with QGIS

One of the most important sites for GIS work is the [Census Bureau's TIGER program](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger.html).

It is a tremendous resource of boundary maps of all kinds: states, legislative districts, congressional districts, counties, cities and so on. 

Let's go to the [download page](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html) and click on the link for the web interface.
